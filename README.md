# Broken Delivery Service

Game made for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam with the theme out of control.

I participated in the jam with the Last Minute Team ([@flaviocravero](https://soundcloud.com/flaviocravero) and [@portluc](https://www.deviantart.com/aewron)) we submitted this plataformer where the player doesn't choose when the character will jump.
